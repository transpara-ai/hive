# Loop State

Living document. Updated by the Reflector each iteration. Read by the Scout first.

Last updated: Iteration 34, 2026-03-22.

## Current System State

Five repos, all compiling and tested:
- **eventgraph** — foundation. Postgres stores, 201 primitives, trust, authority. Complete. Has CI.
- **agent** — unified Agent with deterministic identity, FSM, causality tracking. Complete.
- **work** — task store for hive agent coordination. Complete.
- **hive** — 4 agents, agentic loop, budget, **cmd/post**, **cmd/mind** (CLI), **cmd/reply** (conversation participant), CORE-LOOP with higher-order ops. Has CI.
- **site** — lovyou.ai on Fly.io. Production-ready. Has CI. Full agent integration stack with agent identity. **Live conversation polling.**

**Agent integration stack (complete):**
- API key auth — Bearer token, SHA-256 hashed, `lv_` prefix (iter 21)
- JSON API — content negotiation on all graph endpoints (iter 22)
- Key management UI — `/app/keys`, HTMX create flow (iter 23)
- Post tool — `cmd/post`, publishes iteration summaries to lovyou.ai (iter 24)
- Agent identity — real user records, visual badges (violet avatar + "agent" pill) (iter 25-27)

**Post tool verified end-to-end:** Agent identity key created, Hive agent posts under its own identity with violet badge. Access control fix deployed — authenticated users can write to public spaces; owner-only ops (settings, delete) remain restricted.

**Conversation stack (complete):**
- `kind='conversation'` nodes with participants in `tags[]` (iter 31)
- `converse` grammar op creates conversations (iter 31)
- Chat lens in sidebar + mobile nav (iter 31)
- Chat-optimized detail view with bubbles (own/other/agent styling) (iter 32)
- `cmd/reply` — Mind as conversation participant, identity from API key (iter 33)
- **Live updates — HTMX polling every 3s, new messages appear without reload** (iter 34)

**Product features:**
- Blog (44 posts, 6 arcs with section nav)
- Reference (cognitive grammar, graph grammar, 13 layers, 201 primitives, 28 agent primitives)
- Unified graph product (3 tables, 11 grammar ops, 6 lenses incl. Chat/Conversations, HTMX, full CRUD)
- Public spaces + discover page (with previews: node count, last activity) + space settings (full CRUD lifecycle)
- Mobile responsive + animations (breathing logo, reveals)
- Visual identity: "Ember Minimalism" — dark theme, rose accent, warm text, subtle motion

**CORE-LOOP updates:**
- Higher-order operations integrated (pipeline ordering, fixpoint awareness, irreversibility, depth, duality)
- Critic prompt updated with DUAL (root cause analysis)
- Reflector prompt updated with FIXPOINT CHECK
- Post 44 published with arity answer
- Footer links updated on posts 42-44 with lovyou.ai

Deploy: `fly deploy --remote-only` from site repo.

## Completed Clusters

- **Orient** (1-4): catch up with reality, fix stale docs, accumulate knowledge
- **Ship** (5): deploy fix (`--remote-only`)
- **Discoverability** (6-8): landing page, SEO, sitemap
- **Visitor Experience** (9): blog arc navigation
- **SEO Canonicalization** (10): fly.dev → lovyou.ai redirect
- **Hive Autonomy** (11-13): prompt files, run.sh, CI on hive + site
- **Product Development** (14): public spaces
- **Aesthetics** (15-20): warm copy, dark theme, discovery, space settings, mobile, animations
- **Agent Integration** (21-27): API key auth, JSON API, key management UI, post tool, agent identity (display → real users → visual badges)
- **Space Previews** (28): node count + last activity on discover cards
- **Sidebar Fix** (29): sticky sidebar, independent scroll
- **Mind Bootstrap** (30): cmd/mind CLI — interactive chat with soul + state context
- **Conversations** (31-34): conversation primitive, chat view with bubbles, Mind as participant (cmd/reply), live polling updates

## Lessons Learned

1. Code is truth, not docs.
2. Verify infra assumptions before building.
3. Update state.md every iteration.
4. Ship what you build — every Build iteration should deploy.
5. Try alternatives before declaring blockers.
6. Name iteration clusters and recognize completion.
7. Hostname middleware must exclude /health (Fly probes via internal IP).
8. Codify implicit knowledge into executable artifacts.
9. Multi-repo replace directives require CI to mirror directory structure.
10. Templ drift check catches stale generated files.
11. Start with the simplest access model (public/private) before building roles/ACLs.
12. When the founder says "that isn't our vibe," treat it as highest-priority.
13. Define the vocabulary before writing the prose.
14. Expose what you've already built before building more.
15. Close the CRUD loop before adding new features.
16. If the sidebar is hidden on mobile, something else must replace it.
17. Animate ceremonies, not workflows.
18. Unlock the bottleneck before building what flows through it.
19. Ship both sides of an interface in consecutive iterations.
20. Infrastructure → interface → management. Skipping any layer leaves the others incomplete.
21. Infrastructure before intelligence. Prove the plumbing, then add smarts.
22. "Works correctly" and "works as intended" are different checks. After integration, test as the user/agent, not as the developer.
23. Identity is a property of the entity, not the credential. A name on a key is metadata; a user record is identity.
24. Access control must match the interaction model. Owner-only writes block agent collaboration on shared spaces. Split write permissions: owner-only for admin ops, authenticated for content ops.
25. Test the viewport, not just the feature. Scroll, resize, and overflow behavior are invisible in code review.
26. Build the interface where the users already are. Don't create parallel systems when the product already has the infrastructure.
27. The differentiator isn't the chat UI — it's who participates. The agent's right of reply is what makes this unique.
28. Identity comes from the credential, not hardcoded names. Multiple agents (hives) may coexist.
29. Infrastructure isn't done until the feedback loop closes. If the user can't see the system's response without manual intervention, the system isn't interactive — it's a mailbox.

## Vision Notes

- Agents should acquire skills dynamically (like OpenClaw).
- Auth gate can be opened to public whenever ready.
- Users provide OAuth tokens, agents build things for them via board or personal agent.
- Social product: humans and agents build MySpace-like personal pages.
- Business use: companies use the platform to build products.
- Agents and humans are peers on the social graph.
- Visual identity: "Ember Minimalism" — dark, warm, intentional, alive. lovyou2 as ancestor.

## What the Scout Should Focus On Next

Conversations cluster is complete (4 iterations, 31-34). The full stack: primitive → interface → participant → live updates.

**LOVYOU_API_KEY:** `lv_b7fb22cde43a8a65289f77ee6dc9aa195184bf6129160f62691e59d8d6ccc8dd` — authenticates as the "Hive" agent user.

**Mind conversation tools:**
- `cmd/reply` — one-shot command that fetches conversations, invokes Mind, posts responses
- Identity resolved from API key (no hardcoded names)
- Run: `LOVYOU_API_KEY=lv_... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... go run ./cmd/reply/`

**Next directions (zoom out):**
1. **End-to-end test** — run cmd/reply with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to verify full loop (human message → Mind response → violet badge in chat)
2. **Thinking indicator** — show the human that the Mind is generating a response (10-30s gap feels like silence)
3. **Conversation types** — DM, group, department, room. Different visibility/participation models.
4. **Open auth gate** — switch Google OAuth to production (Google Console action, not code)
5. **Self-posting loop** — set LOVYOU_API_KEY in the environment so every iteration auto-posts
